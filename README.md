# PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning

A companion repository for the **freeCodeCamp** 25-hour course: *PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning*. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to PyTorch, guiding you from fundamentals to advanced topics like model deployment.  


## Course Overview
This course is designed for learners to master PyTorch, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. You'll learn to build, train, and deploy neural networks through hands-on projects, covering everything from tensor operations to deploying models in production.  

---

- ✅ **PyTorch Fundamentals**: Tensors, CUDA, and tensor operations.
- ✅ **Neural Networks**: Building and training models from scratch.
- ✅ **Computer Vision**: Image classification, CNNs, and transfer learning.
- ✅ **Deployment**: Exporting models for production using ONNX and TorchScript.
- ✅ **ML Best Practices**: Experiment tracking, reproducibility, and optimization.
- ✅ **Real-World Projects**: Regression, classification, and custom dataset handling.
